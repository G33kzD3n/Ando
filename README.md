# Ionic

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to
build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies.

Ionic is based on [Angular](https://angular.io/) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and
feature improvements over the past versions.

See the [Building Apps with Ionic](https://adamdbradley.github.io/building-with-ionic2) slides for a quick
overview or watch our [Crash Course](https://youtu.be/O2WiI9QrS5s) video for a quick walkthrough on how to get
started using Ionic.
